        feedback:
          "Based on the patient's high-risk status and the contributing factors you've provided, it is advisable for the patient to schedule a medical checkup every 3 months.\n\n### Reason for This Timing:\n1. **Age**: At 60 years old, the patient is at an increased risk for various health issues, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Regular checkups can help monitor these risks.\n  \n2. **High Systolic Blood Pressure**: A reading of 185 mmHg indicates hypertension, which requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications like heart disease or stroke.\n\n3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 140 mg/dL suggests the patient may be at risk for diabetes. Regular checkups will allow for monitoring of blood sugar levels and early intervention if necessary.\n\n4. **High Triglycerides**: With a level of 250 mg/dL, this can increase the risk of heart disease. Regular checkups can help manage and lower these levels through lifestyle changes or medications.\n\n5. **Increased BMI**: A BMI of 32 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for many chronic conditions. Regular checkups can help track weight and provide guidance on healthy lifestyle changes.\n\nIn summary, coming in every 3 months will allow for timely monitoring and intervention, helping to manage these risk factors effectively.",
        Recommendation:
          "To help reduce your risk, focus on adopting a healthier lifestyle. Aim to maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing sugar and saturated fats. Regular exercise, such as walking for at least 30 minutes most days, can also be beneficial. Additionally, monitor your blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels regularly, and consider discussing medication or supplements with your healthcare provider if necessary. Lastly, ensure you have regular check-ups to keep track of your overall health.",
